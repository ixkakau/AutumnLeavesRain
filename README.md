Falling Autumn Leaves
Autumn Leaves is a beautiful Jazz standard. This animation makes tribute to it. The tracks on the background are from Miles Davis, Edith Piaf, Eric Clapton, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, and a last one from Beth Gibbons called Mysteries. The latter is an exception but adoc to the theme of this script. Leaves were edited using Gimp and Krita; Music was converted to .wav using VLC. The animation is done using pygame.
Enjoy the music!
