# AutumnLeavesRain
Falling autumn leaves with music on the background.
Autumn Leaves is a beautiful Jazz standard and this animation makes tribute to it. The tracks are from Miles Davis, Edith Piaf, Eric Clapton, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, and one from Beth Gibbons called Mysteries; the latter an exception. Leaves' pngs were created and edited using Gimp and Krita; Music was converted to .ogg using VLC. The animation is done using pygame.Enjoy the music!

###currently trying to fix memory leak: leaves stay in the background forever###
